# Interactive UI

:::

Interactive UI is an extension of [Custom UI](./custom-ui.md). It allows interfaces returned from [`snap_dialog`](../reference/snaps-api.md#snap_dialog), [`onTransaction`](../reference/entry-points.md#ontransaction), and [`onHomePage`](../reference/entry-points.md#onhomepage) to respond to user input.
